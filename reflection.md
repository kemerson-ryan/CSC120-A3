I worked with Janna Gillesman and Chelsea Fowler on this assignment. We attended TA hours on Friday, and collaborated in creating things like the mirror word dictionary, and earlier on, discussed the differences between next() and nextLine() which was quite helpful. 

I am a fan of Java, as I've worked with the very similar Processing before, and I'm enjoying the online documentation that is so thorough. I do enjoy java's preciseness because I know where issues come from, and the error messages are often helpful. I am benefitting greatly from all the online sites that other Java users have asked and answered questions on with example code, because it gives me a wonderful example of how it could work and what step I'm missing. 

What didn't work was trying to change multiple things at one time, working on two steps of the level at once. I messed up quite a few times by starting with one thing and moving to another before the first thing was complete, giving me quite a mess of error messages. I ended up restarting the document and typing it all again a few times, but easier and easier each time knowing what tools are at my disposal. For advice it would definitely be start small. And not just a small system but a small step in a small system, testing each step as you go. Clearly it works well once it's done correctly. I definitely needed to keep a clear working space, but felt it difficult to do that if I wanted to comment lines out to save them for later use somewhere else. Perhaps in the future I'll make a little section in my file to keep un-used lines and comment about their functionalities to reserve for later. Another piece of advice is to keep a list of those things, how they work, so they can be applied elsewhere when the occasion arrises that they are needed again.
